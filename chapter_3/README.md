In this chapter we create a sample java spring boot application to be deployed as a microservices and expose a rest endpoint to ensure that our users are able to access this endpoint.This chapter explains the different tools and technologies used to develop the application and provide the sample code to users.  

## Code action
aws-code-pipeline directory contains the source code for sample microservice.
### How to build source code
Use `mvn clean install` to build the source code. 
Use `java -j target/aws-code-pipeline*.jar` to run the spring boot application
